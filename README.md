# pxt-comment-block
<h3>Provides a custom block for displaying user comments<br>
inline for MakeCode block-style programming.</h3>

#### How To Use It
Import this repo as an extension to the MakeCode editor. A "Comment" group will appear amongst the main list of blocks groups, wearing a dark orange color.
